                    Utilizing OpenCV and C++, I made a system that was meant 
                    for usage in small-parts quality control, specifically washers.
                    The camera would be calibrated against a correct washer and 
                    the number of pixels across a correct washer was would be 
                    inputted into the system via a series of sliders.

                    Utilizing a Raspberry Pi and a SparkFun GPS-RTK2 sensor,
                    I attempted to build a system that would take GPS coordinates
                    and auto-adjust a spotlight based on an actor's position on a 
                    stage. This ultimately ran into issues regarding poor signal 
                    within buildings, but for open-air stages such as concerts 
                    (rather than theater performances), this may still work. To the 
                    right is a preliminary sketch of a garment that would allow the 
                    sensor to be worn.

                <p style="text-align: right">A website created for an imaginary non-profit organization (Rochester Rivers). 
                    The site featured two types of users - Admins and Helpers. Admins could manage
                    items that the organization required within the store, and Helpers could
                    purchase these items for the organization. Helpers had unique baskets (functionally
                    equivalent to an online shopping cart), the contents of which would be preserved if
                    the user exited the site.
