        <p style="text-align:left"><span>Utilizing a Raspberry Pi and a SparkFun GPS-RTK2 sensor,<br>
                 I attempted to build a system that would take GPS coordinates<br>
                 and auto-adjust a spotlight based on an actor's position on a <br> stage.
                This ultimately ran into issues regarding poor signal <br> 
                within buildings, but for open-air stages such as concerts <br>
                (rather than theater performances), this may still work. </span><img src="Assets/teriyaki_chicken.jpg" width="700" height="400" align="right"></p>
