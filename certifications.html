        <h1>Certifications</h1>

        <p class="summary">I have spent the summar of 2024 pursuing independent certifications
            through freeCodeCamp. I have just recently finished their Responsive
            Web Development certification, and intend to begin their Javascript
            Algorithms and Data Structures certification shortly. Shown below is my
            certification from each course that I have completed thus far.
