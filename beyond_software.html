        <p>
            I'm a software engineer with a passion for AI, but beyond <br>
            that I have a variety of hobbies including gardening, <br>
            digital art, and listening to audiobooks. <br>

                    I have an large indoor garden featuring a variety of plants,
                    including spiderplants, pothos, peace lilies, and more. I used 
                    to have an outdoor garden, but now mostly help out with my 
                    partner's family's garden. <br> Also pictured in this photo is one of
                    my two cats, Annette.

                    I've been passionate about both digital and traditional art 
                    for many years, and during the pandemic I was able to practice
                    and improve a great deal. Now I mainly draw while listening to 
                    audiobooks, with the most recent book I've listened to being Pride
                    and Prejudice. To the right is a digital painting from S26 E4 of 
                    Bob Ross' The Joy of Painting.
