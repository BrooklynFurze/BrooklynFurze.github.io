        <p>
            I'm a software engineer with a passion for AI, but beyond <br>
            that I have a variety of hobbies including gardening, <br>
            digital art, and listening to audiobooks. <br>

                    I have an large indoor garden featuring a variety of plants,
                    including spiderplants, pothos, peace lilies, and more. I used 
                    to have an outdoor garden, but now mostly help out with my 
                    partner's family's garden. <br> Also pictured in this photo is one of
                    my two cats, Annette.

                    I've been passionate about both digital and traditional art 
                    for many years, and during the pandemic I was able to practice
                    and improve a great deal. Now I mainly draw while listening to 
                    audiobooks, as I find it quite relaxing.

                    When I was much younger, I greatly enjoyed reading. However, 
                    nowadays I find that I barely have the time to read. As such, 
                    I've resorted to listening to audiobooks, through both Spotify
                    and another app called Libby that I have access to through my
                    local library. I have just finished listening to Warcross by 
                    Marie Lu, and I am now reading Wildcard, its sequel. Before this,
                    I listened to To Sleep in A Sea of Stars by Christopher Paolini. 
                    Additionally, I have been listening to The Complete Fiction of 
                    H.P. Lovecraft through Spotify, but since Spotify caps users at 
                    15 hours of audiobook per month and it is 50 hours long, its taking
                    a bit longer than those through the library.
