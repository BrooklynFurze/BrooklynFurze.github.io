    Hi, my name is Brooklyn Furze, and I graduated from the 
Academy for Science and Design in Nashua, NH. I enjoy gardening, 
digital art, and video games such as Hollow Knight and Hades.
I am a Performing Arts scholar for theater tech, in the Honors
program, and a part of the Bachelors to Masters program (getting 
my Masters in Computer Science). <br>

My favorite food is teriyaki chicken stir fry (picture shown below). <br>
